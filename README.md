# FIT3175 - Usability
#### Notes prepared by [Sharsindra Pratheen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/k-sharsindra-pratheen-92a807193/) :radioactive:

This primarily serves as an archive of personal notes in addition to the lecture slides and study materials provided in class. It took me countless hours to prepare them but knowing it's a good source of reference for the future and the thought of aiding the next generations kept me going, it's the way of a [Jedi Master](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Master).

Feel free to use them and if you wish to add anything, just [upload](https://github.com/kspra3/FIT3175-Notes/issues/new) here. A huge thanks to [Monash University](http://www.monash.edu) for providing me with an education, although as they would say, Ancora Imparo!
