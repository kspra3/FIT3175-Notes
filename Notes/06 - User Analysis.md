# User Analysis
1. **Interviews** 
    * Unstructured.
        * You don’t plan in advance. Maybe you know your initial question, then you just go with the flow.
        * This results in really rich, deep data. But makes replication impossible and can make analysis more ad-hoc/difficult, if you are not careful.
    * Structured
        * Tightly scripted. Almost a spoken questionnaire.
        * Simple to replicate, simple to analyse. No opportunity for you to respond to something really interesting and (perhaps) unexpected.
    * Semi-structured
        * More of a plan, such as topics/themes you want to cover. But also more open to exploration and deviation.
        * Pseudo-replicable, somewhat comparable across interviewees, medium difficult to analyse.

2. **Questionnaires**

3. **Observations**

4. **Contextual Inquiry (Ethnography)**
      * Contextual inquiry departs from ethnography as a methodology. However, in reality much of the formality is trimmed due to business pressures.
      * This means that 3 month field trips become 3 hours, where 1 hour is still an interview.
      * Extensive data exploration and analysis, becomes lightweight business reporting and requirement capture. Regardless, this still takes more time than the previous interview techniques, results
in complex data (where strict analysis is hard), but provides more reliable contextual information and insight.
      * Its hard to do for a larger sample, however. Works if your participants are homogenous, or if you are designing something very specific or niche.

5. **Experience Sampling**
      * A bit like a questionnaire. But, you ask them the same question over and over again. Perhaps, you ask them the question every 2 hours. Perhaps, you ask them every time they do a thing. It doesn’t have to be _one_ question. 

6. **Diary Studies**
      * You can think of diary studies as a slightly longer, slightly less frequent, slightly less guided experience sampling technique.
      * Perhaps once a day, or once a week, you get your ‘participants’ to respond, typically in an open-ended way, to a prompt about their behaviour, opinions, frustrations, etc.
      * This is really well suited to behaviour change interventions. Though that is, by no means, their only use.
      * Easy to remember this one: you basically get a diary at the end, of someone’s musings over a longer period of time

7. **Quantitative Data Collection** ([next chapter](https://github.com/kspra3/FIT3175-Notes/blob/master/Notes/07%20-%20Qualitative%20v%20Quantitative.md))
