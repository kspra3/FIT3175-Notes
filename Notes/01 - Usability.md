# Usability
The ISO Definition: [**Usability**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability) is the extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with **effectiveness**, **efficiency** and **satisfaction** in a specified _context_ of use.

**Effectiveness** - Accuracy and completeness with which users achieve specified goals.

**Efficiency** - Resources expended in relation to the 'effectiveness' with which users achieve goals.

**Satisfaction** - Freedom from discomfort and positive attitude towards the use of the product.

### Additional Definition
[The Interaction Design Foundation](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/usability): Usability is part of the broader term “user experience” and refers to the ease of access and/or use of a product or website. A design is not usable or unusable _per se_; its features, together with the context of the user (what the user wants to do with it and the user’s
environment), determine its level of usability.

[Jakob Nielsen (2012)](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/): “Usability is a quality attribute that assesses
how easy user interfaces are to use. The word "usability" also refers to methods for improving ease-of-use during the design process. “Usability is defined by 5 quality components, Learnability, Efficiency, Memorability, Errors and Satisfaction”

### User Experience (UX)
The ISO Definition: User Experience (UX) is a person's perceptions and responses resulting from the use and/or anticipated use of a product, system or service.
* UXers will tell you that Usability is a sub-set of UX.
* That UX has a broader interest in the Why, What, and How of product use. 

### Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
The ISO Definition: Scientific discipline concerned with the understanding of interactions among human and other elements of a system, and the profession that applies theory, principles, data and methods to design in order to optimize human well-being and overall system performance.
* Similarly, HCIers will tell you that usability is a sub-set of HCI.
* For example, ‘User Experience and Usability’ is one of the sub-communities of HCI’s biggest conference.

### Why are we learning about Usability?
* First, it is very important to think about your user. You can be the best at software development, but no one will use your software if you neglect the users.
* Second, there is a high demand out there for experts in Usability / UX / HCI. :moneybag: :moneybag: :moneybag:
